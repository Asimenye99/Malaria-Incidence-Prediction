# Malaria-Incidence-Prediction
This repository is for structured data storage in developing a predictive model of Malaria incidence in Malawi
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for malaria incidence by integrating climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and vegetation indices. The goal is to better understand the relationship between climate dynamics and malaria transmission, and to provide a data-driven tool for forecasting malaria risk.

By combining epidemiological data with climate and environmental datasets, the model will help inform:

Public health surveillance

Malaria control and elimination strategies

Climate adaptation and resilience planning

🎯 Objectives

Collect and preprocess malaria incidence and climate data.

Explore spatial and temporal relationships between malaria and climate drivers.

Develop and evaluate predictive models.

Visualize predictions and risk maps for decision-making.
